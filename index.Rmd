## Motivation

All of you remember the Regression Models Course Project
where you tested different variable sets for the regression model...

```{r} 
fit <- lm(mpg~cyl+hp+wt+am, data=mtcars)
summary(fit)
```


I've found this process very tedious and have developed
the automated solution for this.

You can select the outcome and predictors and instantly run the model
without a line of R code.

Now you can add variables to your model in one mouse click!

## Future Directions

- More output

- Ability to explore other datasets

- Variable interactions

- Model comparison with ANOVA

- Other types of regression models

- ???????

- PROFIT
